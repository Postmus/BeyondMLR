## Introduction

You will work with longitudinal data from a growth curve study. The dataset captures weight measurements of 568 Asian children, recorded during clinic visits on up to five occasions. Ages range from approximately 6 weeks to 27 months. Your task is to model the children's growth trajectories over time.

This dataset was sourced from the data library of the centre for Multilevel Modelling, University of Bristol.

## Dataset description

The dataset consists of the following variables:

- `ChildID`: Unique identifier for each child
- `Age`: Child's age at the time of measurement (months)
- `Weight`: Child's weight at the time of measurement (grams)
- `Gender`: Child's gender (Boy or Girl)

## Objectives

Your objectives are to:

1. Develop an appropriate model to describe the growth curve of children's weight over time, considering fixed and random effects.
2. Use the model to answer the following research questions:
   - How does the weight of children change over time (e.g., constant, linear, quadratic)?
   - How does gender influence the mean growth curve of children's weight?

## Steps to complete the analysis

### Load the dataset

Download the dataset (see link in the Downloads section below) and read it into R. Ensure that the `Gender` variable is correctly encoded as a factor.

### Exploratory data analysis

- Explore the individual and mean trajectories of weight gain over time.

### Model building

- Begin with a comprehensive (saturated) model and iteratively simplify it to determine the best fixed and random effects structure.
- Use likelihood ratio tests to refine random effects (models not refitted with ML).
- Use likelihood ratio tests with models refitted using ML to refine fixed effects.

### Interpret the results

Interpret the findings from your analysis, focusing on answering the research questions outlined in the Objectives section.

## Requirements for the report

Your report should clearly explain:

1. The reasoning behind your choice of model structure.
2. The interpretation of key model parameters in the context of the research questions.
3. Any limitations or assumptions affecting your analysis.

Submit both the **Quarto source file (`.qmd`)** and the **rendered HTML file**. Ensure that the HTML file includes visible code (`echo = TRUE`) for reproducibility.
