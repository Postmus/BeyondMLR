1,"quality_of_life","Quality of Life","sex","Sex","Investigate how sex affects quality of life recovery trajectories in cardiac surgery patients. Additionally, examine whether the rehabilitation program (Standard vs Enhanced) moderates the recovery pattern.","Males may report higher QoL. Enhanced rehab may accelerate recovery."
2,"walk_distance","6-minute walk distance","sex","Sex","Investigate how sex affects 6-minute walk distance recovery trajectories in cardiac surgery patients. Additionally, examine whether the rehabilitation program (Standard vs Enhanced) moderates the recovery pattern.","Males likely walk further. Enhanced rehab may accelerate improvement."
3,"depression_score","Depression (PHQ-9)","sex","Sex","Investigate how sex affects depression (phq-9) recovery trajectories in cardiac surgery patients. Additionally, examine whether the rehabilitation program (Standard vs Enhanced) moderates the recovery pattern.","Females may report higher depression. Enhanced rehab may improve mental health."
4,"quality_of_life","Quality of Life","diabetes","Diabetes status","Investigate how diabetes status affects quality of life recovery trajectories in cardiac surgery patients. Additionally, examine whether the rehabilitation program (Standard vs Enhanced) moderates the recovery pattern.","Diabetes associated with lower QoL. Enhanced rehab may help diabetic patients more."
5,"walk_distance","6-minute walk distance","diabetes","Diabetes status","Investigate how diabetes status affects 6-minute walk distance recovery trajectories in cardiac surgery patients. Additionally, examine whether the rehabilitation program (Standard vs Enhanced) moderates the recovery pattern.","Diabetes associated with shorter walk distance. Enhanced rehab may help."
