While dummy coding is widely used in multiple linear regression models, effects coding is more common in ANOVA models as it enables interpretation of group differences relative to the grand mean rather than a single reference category. This interpretative difference makes effects coding particularly useful for examining group-level effects in experimental designs.\nTo change the coding scheme globally to effects coding:\n\n# Set contrasts to effects coding globally\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Effects coding\n\nTo reset the coding scheme to the default dummy coding:\n\n# Reset contrasts to default dummy coding\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Dummy coding\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Estimation\nWe can fit the one-way ANOVA model using the lm() function:\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Effects coding\ncontrasts(data_oneway$Treatment) # Inspect contrasts for Treatment\n\n# Fitting the model with effects coding\nmodel_oneway &lt;- lm(BP_change ~ Treatment, data = data_oneway)\nsummary(model_oneway)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nHow do the estimated coefficients relate to the group means?\n\n\n\n\nANOVA Table\nTo test whether the effect of treatment is statistically significant, we use the anova() function to obtain the ANOVA table:\n\n# ANOVA table\nanova_results &lt;- anova(model_oneway)\nanova_results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat does the F-test tell us about the treatment effect?\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Marginal Means\nEstimated marginal means, also known as least-squares means, are model-based means that represent the predicted (or expected) response at each level of a factor, averaged over the levels of other variables in the model.\nIn the context of a one-way ANOVA, where there is only one factor (e.g., treatment group), the estimated marginal means are equal to the observed group means. In more complex models with multiple factors, estimated marginal means provide predicted group means that are averaged over the levels of these additional factors. For example, in a model with both treatment and age as factors, the estimated marginal means for the treatment groups show the treatment means averaged over age, illustrating what these group means are expected to be at specific values of age (or averaged over a grid of age values).\nWe can calculate the estimated marginal means using the emmeans() function from the emmeans package:\n\n# Obtain estimated marginal means\nemms &lt;- emmeans(model_oneway, ~ Treatment)\nemms  # displays EMMs with standard errors and 95% confidence intervals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nHow do the estimated marginal means compare to the observed group means calculated during the exploratory data analysis?\n\n\n\n\nPairwise comparisons\nSince we found a significant treatment effect, we will conduct pairwise comparisons of the estimated marginal means to identify which specific treatment groups differ significantly from one another. We perform these pairwise comparisons using the pairs() function from the emmeans package. To account for the increased risk of Type I error due to multiple comparisons, we apply the Bonferroni correction to adjust the p-values, ensuring that the overall significance level remains controlled.\n\n# Performing post-hoc analysis with emmeans\npairs(emms, adjust=\"Bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the pairwise comparisons, which treatment groups differ significantly?\n\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\nTo assess the adequacy of the fitted model, we create two diagnostic plots:\n\nResiduals vs Fitted Plot: Used to assess homoscedasticity (constant variance) for the errors. A random scatter of residuals around zero indicates equal variance.\nNormal Q-Q Plot: Used to assess normality of the errors. Residuals following the reference line suggest normally distributed errors.\n\n\n# Residuals vs Fitted\nplot(model_oneway, which = 1, main = \"Residuals vs Fitted\")\n\n# Normal Q-Q\nplot(model_oneway, which = 2, main = \"Normal Q-Q\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nDo the diagnostic plots suggest any violations of the model assumptions?\n\n\n\n\nReporting\nA one-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant effect of treatment on the change in systolic blood pressure, F(2, 117) = 43.86, p &lt; 0.001.

Pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni-adjusted) indicated statistically significant differences between Drug A and both Drug B (p &lt; 0.001) and the Control group (p &lt; 0.001), but not between Drug B and the Control group (p = 0.291)."

    "section": "A Mixed Effects Model for the Randomized Block Design",
    "text": "A Mixed Effects Model for the Randomized Block Design\nIn a mixed-effects model, both fixed effects and random effects are used to account for different sources of variation.\nIn the wound healing example, it is essential to account for the laboratory facility because differences between laboratories (such as variations in environmental conditions) could influence the outcome. By including laboratory as a blocking variable, we can more efficiently estimate the treatment effects by controlling for this source of variability. This can be statistically achieved by modeling laboratory as either a fixed effect or a random effect.\nWhile we could model laboratory as a fixed effect, treating it as a random effect is preferred in this case for two reasons: first, it better reflects reality, as the laboratories are considered a random sample of possible laboratory conditions; second, it reduces the number of parameters we need to estimate, making the model more parsimonious. Modeling the lab as random allows us to account for variability between laboratories without estimating a separate effect for each one, which ultimately helps to isolate the treatment effects more effectively.\nOn the other hand, treatment is modeled as a fixed effect because we are specifically interested in estimating and comparing the effectiveness of the three particular wound healing treatments (Treatment A, Treatment B, and Treatment C). These treatments are not considered random samples from a larger population of treatments; rather, they are the specific interventions under study. By modeling treatment as a fixed effect, we aim to draw conclusions about the differences between these particular treatments, and their impact on wound healing.\n\nModel Specification\nThe mixed-effects model for our randomized block design can be specified as:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + b_j + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(Y_{ij}\\): The observed wound healing response for treatment \\(i\\) in laboratory \\(j\\).\n\\(\\mu\\): The overall mean response across all treatments and laboratories.\n\\(\\tau_i\\): The fixed effect of treatment \\(i\\), representing the deviation of treatment \\(i\\) from the overall mean \\(\\mu\\).\n\\(b_j\\): The random effect of laboratory \\(j\\), assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma_b^2\\)).\n\\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\): The residual error term, assumed to be independent and normally distributed with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNotation convention\n\n\n\nIn mixed-effects models, fixed effects are typically represented by Greek letters, while random effects are represented by Roman letters. This helps differentiate between the two types of effects in model specification.\n\n\n\n\nModel Estimation\nTo fit the previously specified mixed effects model, we use the lmer() function from the lmeTest package:\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Effects coding\ncontrasts(data_block$Treatment) # Inspect contrasts for Treatment\n\nmodel_block &lt;- lmer(WoundHealing ~ Treatment + (1 | Laboratory), data = data_block)\nsummary(model_block)\n\n\nSyntax overview\nLet’s break down the model formula WoundHealing ~ Treatment + (1 | Laboratory)\n\nWoundHealing ~ Treatment: This specifies that WoundHealing is the outcome variable and that Treatment is included as a fixed effect to estimate differences between the three treatments. Note that the intercept is included by default in the model, so WoundHealing ~ Treatment is essentially a shortcut for WoundHealing ~ 1 + Treatment. Also remember that with effects coding, the intercept represents the overall mean across all levels of the treatment variable, and the treatment coefficients represent deviations from this mean.\n(1 | Laboratory): This specifies the random effect for Laboratory, representing laboratory-specific deviations from the overall mean.\n\n\n\nSummary overview\nWhen you run summary(model_block), the output will display:\n\nFixed Effects: Estimates of the fixed effects\n\nIntercept: The overall mean wound healing score averaged across all treatments and laboratories.\nTreatment: The differences in wound healing associated with each treatment relative to the overall mean.\n\nRandom Effects: Estimates of the variance components\n\nLaboratory - Intercept: Between-laboratory variability (\\(\\sigma^2_{b}\\)).\nResidual: Residual variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningCaution: Interpreting p-values in Mixed Effects Models\n\n\n\nWhile the lmerTest package provides p-values for fixed effects, it is important to use them with caution, primarily because methods for calculating degrees of freedom, such as Satterthwaite, are approximations that may not always be reliable, particularly in complex models fitted to imbalanced data. Hypothesis testing based on likelihood ratio tests may be preferred in those settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the fixed effects\nIn addition to providing p-values for fixed effects estimates, the lmerTest package allows us to assess the overall significance of fixed effects using the anova() function. To further explore the nature of these effects, we can obtain the estimated marginal means for the factor levels in the model. Rather than using the package’s build in ls_means() function, we will use emmeans() function from the emmeans package, which provides more options and greater flexibility.\n\n# Obtain ANOVA table for the fixed effects\nanova(model_block)\n\n\n# Compute estimated marginal means for the Treatment variable\nemms &lt;- emmeans(model_block, ~ Treatment)\nemms # displays EMMs with standard errors and 95% confidence intervals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat does the F-test tell us about the treatment effect?\n\n\n\nPairwise comparisons\nSince we found a significant treatment effect, we proceed with computing pairwise differences of the estimated marginal means:\n\n# Perform pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment\npairs(emms, adjust = \"bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the pairwise comparisons, which treatment groups differ significantly?\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the variance components\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nBased on the estimated variance components from summary(model_block), calculate the intra-class correlation (ICC) and interpret its meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nConsidering these results, do you think that blocking by laboratory was necessary for this experiment?\n\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\nIn mixed-effects models, model diagnostics involve analyzing different types of residuals to evaluate how well the model fits the data and to assess whether key assumptions are satisfied.\nThe default type of residuals used in these models are the conditional residuals, which are calculated based on predicted values that incorporate both fixed effects and estimated random effects. Conditional residuals represent the deviation of the observed data from the model’s predictions, accounting for variability from both sources: fixed effects and random effects. They can be considered estimates of the errors \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\), which are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and constant variance.\nTo check these assumptions, we can generate diagnostic plots similar to those used in linear regression models:\n\nResiduals vs. Fitted Plot: This plot helps check for homoscedasticity (constant variance).\nNormal Q-Q Plot: This plot assesses whether the residuals follow a normal distribution.\n\n\n# Extract conditional residuals\nresiduals_cond &lt;- resid(model_block)\n\n# Residuals vs Fitted\nplot(fitted(model_block), residuals_cond,\n     main = \"Residuals vs Fitted\",\n     xlab = \"Fitted values\",\n     ylab = \"Residuals\")\nabline(h = 0, col = \"red\")\n\n# Normal Q-Q Plot\nqqnorm(residuals_cond)\nqqline(residuals_cond, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nDo the diagnostic plots suggest any violations of the model assumptions regarding the error term?"

Fit a Mixed-Effects Model\n\nFit a mixed-effects model with:\n\nFixed Effects: ExerciseRoutine (to estimate differences between exercise routines).\nRandom Effects:\n\nPatient (to account for variability between individuals).\nPatient × ExerciseRoutine (to account for potential variability in how patients respond to different routines).\n\n\nTest whether the Patient × ExerciseRoutine random interaction term is necessary by comparing the full model (with the interaction term) to a reduced model (without the interaction term).\nBased on the results of this test:\n\nIf the interaction term is significant, proceed with the full model for further analysis.\nIf the interaction term is not significant, proceed with the reduced model.\n\nSummarize the chosen model:\n\nReport the fixed effects and variance components.\n\n\n\n\n4. Test for Overall Differences\n\nUse the selected model to test for overall differences in functional mobility scores across exercise routines.\n\n\n\n5. Perform Pairwise Comparisons\n\nIf significant overall differences are found, calculate estimated marginal means and perform pairwise comparisons to identify which routines differ.\n\n\n\n6. Evaluate Model Assumptions\n\nAssess the model’s assumptions (e.g., normality of residuals, homoscedasticity) using diagnostic plots."
