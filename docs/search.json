    "text": "Performing a One-Way ANOVA\n\nModel Specification\nUsing effects coding, the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model can be specified as:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(Y_{ij}\\): The blood pressure reduction for the \\(j\\)-th patient in the \\(i\\)-th treatment group.\n\\(\\mu\\): The overall mean blood pressure reduction.\n\\(\\tau_i\\): The effect of the \\(i\\)-th treatment (deviation from the overall mean).\n\\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\): The error term, assumed to be independently and normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding schemes for categorical variables\n\n\n\nIn regression models, categorical variables are represented using coding schemes that allow their inclusion as explanatory variables. In R, dummy coding is the default coding scheme for nominal variables, where each level is compared to a reference category. For ordinal variables (i.e., ordered factors), R uses orthogonal polynomials as the default coding scheme, which can capture linear or nonlinear trends across ordered levels.\nWhile dummy coding is widely used in multiple linear regression models, effects coding is more common in ANOVA models, as it enables interpretation of group differences relative to the grand mean rather than a single reference category. This interpretative difference makes effects coding particularly useful for examining group-level effects in experimental designs.\nTo change the coding scheme globally to effects coding:\n\n# Set contrasts to effects coding globally\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Effects coding\n\nTo reset the coding scheme to the default dummy coding:\n\n# Reset contrasts to default dummy coding\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Dummy coding\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Estimation\nWe can fit the one-way ANOVA model using the lm() function:\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Effects coding\n\n# Fitting the model with effects coding\nmodel_oneway &lt;- lm(BP_Reduction ~ Treatment, data = data_oneway)\nsummary(model_oneway)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow do the estimated coefficients relate to the group means?\n\n\n\n\nANOVA Table\nTo test whether the effect of treatment is statistically significant, we use the anova() function to obtain the ANOVA table:\n\n# ANOVA table\nanova_results &lt;- anova(model_oneway)\nanova_results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat does the F-test tell us about the treatment effect?\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Marginal Means\nEstimated marginal means, also known as least-squares means, are model-based means that represent the predicted (or expected) response at each level of a factor, averaged over the levels of other variables in the model.\nIn the context of a one-way ANOVA, where there is only one factor (e.g., treatment group), the estimated marginal means are equal to the observed group means. In more complex models with multiple factors, estimated marginal means provide predicted group means that are averaged over the levels of these additional factors. For example, in a model with both treatment and age as factors, the estimated marginal means for the treatment groups show the treatment means averaged over age, illustrating what these group means are expected to be at specific values of age (or averaged over a grid of age values).\nWe can calculate the estimated marginal means using the emmeans() function from the emmeans package:\n\n# Obtain estimated marginal means\nlibrary(emmeans)\nemms &lt;- emmeans(model_oneway, ~ Treatment)\nemms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow do the estimated marginal means compare to the observed group means calculated during the exploratory data analysis?\n\n\n\n\nPairwise comparisons\nSince we found a significant treatment effect, we will conduct pairwise comparisons of the estimated marginal means to identify which specific treatment groups differ significantly from one another. We perform these pairwise comparisons using the contrast() function from the emmeans package. To account for the increased risk of Type I error due to multiple comparisons, we apply the Bonferroni correction to adjust the p-values, ensuring that the overall significance level remains controlled.\n\n# Performing post-hoc analysis with emmeans\ncontrast(emms, method=\"pairwise\", adjust=\"Bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the pairwise comparisons, which treatment groups differ significantly?\n\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\nTo assess the adequacy of the fitted model, we create two diagnostic plots:\n\nResiduals vs Fitted Plot: Used to assess homoscedasticity (constant variance) for the errors. A random scatter of residuals around zero indicates equal variance.\nNormal Q-Q Plot: Used to assess normality of the errors. Residuals following the reference line suggest normally distributed errors.\n\n\n# Residuals vs Fitted\nplot(model_oneway, which = 1, main = \"Residuals vs Fitted\")\n\n# Normal Q-Q\nplot(model_oneway, which = 2, main = \"Normal Q-Q\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nDo the diagnostic plots suggest any violations of the model assumptions?"

    "section": "Random Effects Model for the One-Way Layout",
    "text": "Random Effects Model for the One-Way Layout\nA random effects model represents variations assumed to arise from a larger population. Unlike fixed effects, which estimate specific differences between levels of a factor, random effects account for variability among factor levels by treating them as random samples from a broader population.\nIn the waist circumference example, the four nurses can be considered a random sample from a larger population of nurses. By modeling “Nurse” as a random effect, we aim to generalize the findings about measurement variability to the broader population of nurses, rather than focusing solely on the four in the study.\n\nModel Specification\nThe random effects model can be specified as:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\mu + b_i + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(Y_{ij}\\): The waist circumference measurement for the \\(j\\)-th observation by the \\(i\\)-th nurse.\n\\(\\mu\\): The overall mean waist circumference.\n\\(b_i\\): The random effect of the \\(i\\)-th nurse, assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2_{b}\\).\n\\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\): The error term, assumed to be independently and normally distributed with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\nThe use of random effects allows us to decompose the total variance in the outcome variable into distinct components, each associated with a different source of variation. In this example, the total variance in waist circumference measurements is split into two variance components:\n\nBetween-nurse variability (\\(\\sigma^2_{b}\\)): This component, represented by the variance of the random effect \\(b_{i}\\), captures the variability in waist circumference measurements attributable to differences among nurses. It reflects how much of the overall variability is due to systematic differences in measurement techniques or practices between nurses.\nResidual variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)): This component, represented by the variance of the error term \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\), captures the variability in waist circumference measurements that remains unexplained by nurse-related differences. It includes measurement error, patient-specific factors, and other unmeasured sources of variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation convention\n\n\n\nIn mixed-effects models, fixed effects are typically represented by Greek letters, while random effects are represented by Roman letters. This helps differentiate between the two types of effects in model specification.\n\n\n\nIntraclass Correlation Coefficient\nThe Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) is a statistical measure that quantifies the proportion of the total variance in the outcome variable that can be attributed to differences between groups. In this context, the ICC measures the extent to which waist circumference measurements are more similar when taken by the same nurse (within-group), compared to the overall variability across all nurses (between-group). In other words, it tells us how strongly measurements are correlated within the same group.\nMathematically, the ICC is calculated as:\n\\[\nICC = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{b}}{\\sigma^2_{b} + \\sigma^2}\n\\]\nInterpretation of ICC:\n\nICC \\(\\approx\\) 0: Indicates that nearly all the variability in waist circumference measurements is due to residual factors (such as patient differences or measurement error). This suggests that nurse-level differences contribute minimally to the total variability, implying a high degree of consistency across nurses in their measurement practices.\nICC \\(\\approx\\) 1: Indicates that nearly all the variability is attributable to differences between nurses. This suggests substantial between-nurse variability, meaning different nurses consistently record different waist circumference measurements.\n\n\n\n\nModel Estimation\nWe will fit the random effects model using the lmer() function from the lme4 package.\n\n# Fitting the random effects model\nlibrary(lme4)\nmodel_random &lt;- lmer(Waist_Circumference ~ 1 + (1 | Nurse), data = data_waist_circumference)\nsummary(model_random)\n\n\nSyntax overview\nLet’s break down the model formula Waist_Circumference ~ 1 + (1 | Nurse)\n\nWaist_Circumference ~ 1: This specifies that Waist_Circumference is the outcome variable and that the fixed effects structure consists of a single intercept, modeled by the term 1, that represents the overall mean waist circumference across all nurses.\n(1 | Nurse): This specifies the random effect for Nurse, representing nurse-specific deviations from the overall mean.\n\n\n\nSummary overview\nWhen you run summary(model_random), the output will display:\n\nFixed Effects: Estimates of the fixed effects\n\nIntercept: The overall mean waist circumference across all nurses.\n\nRandom Effects: Estimates of the two variance components\n\nNurse - Intercept: Between-nurse variability (\\(\\sigma^2_{b}\\)).\nResidual: Residual variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo p-values\n\n\n\nThe lme4 package does not provide p-values for fixed effect estimates. This is a deliberate choice by the package authors, based on concerns about the appropriateness of traditional hypothesis testing methods in the context of mixed effects models. In subsequent labs, we will use of the lmerTest package to calculate these p-values and add them to the summary output.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the variance components\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat proportion of the total variance is attributable to nurse differences (i.e., what is the value of the ICC)?\n\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\nIn mixed-effects models, model diagnostics involve analyzing different types of residuals to evaluate how well the model fits the data and to assess whether key assumptions are satisfied.\nThe default type of residuals used in these models are the conditional residuals, which are calculated based on predicted values that incorporate both fixed effects and estimated random effects. Conditional residuals represent the deviation of the observed data from the model’s predictions, accounting for variability from both sources: fixed effects and random effects. They can be considered estimates of the errors \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\), which are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and constant variance.\nTo check these assumptions, we can generate diagnostic plots similar to those used in linear regression models:\n\nResiduals vs. Fitted Plot: This plot helps check for homoscedasticity (constant variance).\nNormal Q-Q Plot: This plot assesses whether the residuals follow a normal distribution.\n\n\n# Extract conditional residuals and predicted values\nresiduals_model_random &lt;- resid(model_random)\nfitted_model_random &lt;- fitted(model_random)\n\n# Residuals vs Fitted\nggplot(data.frame(Fitted = fitted_model_random, Residuals = residuals_model_random), aes(x = Fitted, y = Residuals)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title = \"Residuals vs Fitted\",\n       x = \"Fitted Values\", y = \"Residuals\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Normal Q-Q\nqqnorm(residuals_model_random, main = \"Normal Q-Q\")\nqqline(residuals_model_random)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nDo the diagnostic plots suggest any violations of the model assumptions regarding the error term?"
