    "text": "Performing a One-Way ANOVA\n\nModel Specification\nUsing effects coding, the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model can be specified as:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(Y_{ij}\\): The blood pressure reduction for the \\(j\\)-th patient in the \\(i\\)-th treatment group.\n\\(\\mu\\): The overall mean blood pressure reduction.\n\\(\\tau_i\\): The effect of the \\(i\\)-th treatment (deviation from the overall mean).\n\\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\): The error term, assumed to be independently and normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding schemes for categorical variables\n\n\n\nIn regression models, categorical variables are represented using coding schemes that allow their inclusion as explanatory variables. In R, dummy coding is the default coding scheme for nominal variables, where each level is compared to a reference category. For ordinal variables (i.e., ordered factors), R uses orthogonal polynomials as the default coding scheme, which can capture linear or nonlinear trends across ordered levels.\nWhile dummy coding is widely used in multiple linear regression models, effects coding is more common in ANOVA models, as it enables interpretation of group differences relative to the grand mean rather than a single reference category. This interpretative difference makes effects coding particularly useful for examining group-level effects in experimental designs.\nTo change the coding scheme globally to effects coding:\n\n# Set contrasts to effects coding globally\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Effects coding\n\nTo reset the coding scheme to the default dummy coding:\n\n# Reset contrasts to default dummy coding\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Dummy coding\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Estimation\nWe can fit the one-way ANOVA model using the lm() function:\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Effects coding\n\n# Fitting the model with effects coding\nmodel_oneway &lt;- lm(BP_Reduction ~ Treatment, data = data_oneway)\nsummary(model_oneway)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow do the estimated coefficients relate to the group means?\n\n\n\n\nANOVA Table\nTo test whether the effect of treatment is statistically significant, we use the anova() function to obtain the ANOVA table:\n\n# ANOVA table\nanova_results &lt;- anova(model_oneway)\nanova_results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat does the F-test tell us about the treatment effect?\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Marginal Means\nEstimated marginal means, also known as least-squares means, are model-based means that represent the predicted (or expected) response at each level of a factor, averaged over the levels of other variables in the model.\nIn the context of a one-way ANOVA, where there is only one factor (e.g., treatment group), the estimated marginal means are equal to the observed group means. In more complex models with multiple factors, estimated marginal means provide predicted group means that are averaged over the levels of these additional factors. For example, in a model with both treatment and age as factors, the estimated marginal means for the treatment groups show the treatment means averaged over age, illustrating what these group means are expected to be at specific values of age (or averaged over a grid of age values).\nWe can calculate the estimated marginal means using the emmeans() function from the emmeans package:\n\n# Obtain estimated marginal means\nlibrary(emmeans)\nemms &lt;- emmeans(model_oneway, ~ Treatment)\nemms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow do the estimated marginal means compare to the observed group means calculated during the exploratory data analysis?\n\n\n\n\nPairwise comparisons\nSince we found a significant treatment effect, we will conduct pairwise comparisons of the estimated marginal means to identify which specific treatment groups differ significantly from one another. We perform these pairwise comparisons using the contrast() function from the emmeans package. To account for the increased risk of Type I error due to multiple comparisons, we apply the Bonferroni correction to adjust the p-values, ensuring that the overall significance level remains controlled.\n\n# Performing post-hoc analysis with emmeans\ncontrast(emms, method=\"pairwise\", adjust=\"Bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the pairwise comparisons, which treatment groups differ significantly?\n\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\nTo assess the adequacy of the fitted model, we create two diagnostic plots:\n\nResiduals vs Fitted Plot: Used to assess homoscedasticity (constant variance) for the errors. A random scatter of residuals around zero indicates equal variance.\nNormal Q-Q Plot: Used to assess normality of the errors. Residuals following the reference line suggest normally distributed errors.\n\n\n# Residuals vs Fitted\nplot(model_oneway, which = 1, main = \"Residuals vs Fitted\")\n\n# Normal Q-Q\nplot(model_oneway, which = 2, main = \"Normal Q-Q\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nDo the diagnostic plots suggest any violations of the model assumptions?"
