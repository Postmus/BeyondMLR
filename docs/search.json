This design allowed us to control for variability between laboratories and efficiently estimate the effect of treatment. However, a key limitation of this approach is that it does not allow us to assess the extent to which the effect of treatment varies across blocks, a concept known as interaction.\nAn interaction occurs when the effect of one factor (e.g., treatment) is not consistent across levels of another factor (e.g., laboratory). In other words, the effect of a treatment might vary depending on the laboratory conditions. Replicating the treatments within each block allows us to estimate these interaction effects and better understand the variability in treatment outcomes across different settings.\nIn this lab, we extend the randomized block design by adding replication within blocks, so we can estimate the variability within each block and assess the extent to which treatment effects vary across blocks."

    "section": "A Mixed Effects Model for the Replicated Randomized Block Design",
    "text": "A Mixed Effects Model for the Replicated Randomized Block Design\nAs in the previous lab, laboratory is included as a random effect and treatment as a fixed effect in the model. The key new feature is the treatment-by-laboratory interaction term, which is also modeled as a random effect.\nTo understand why the interaction term must also be modeled as random, we need to consider the nature of random effects in this context. Since laboratory is treated as a random effect, we are assuming that the laboratories in the experiment represent a random sample from a larger population of possible laboratory conditions. This means that we are not just interested in the specific laboratories in the study, but in how the treatments would perform across any set of laboratories with varying conditions.\nWhen we include an interaction term between treatment and laboratory, we are asking whether the effect of each treatment depends on the laboratory environment. If we had modeled laboratory as a fixed effect (i.e., we were only interested in those specific laboratories), the interaction could also be treated as fixed. However, because laboratory is random, the interaction must also be treated as random to reflect the idea that the variability in treatment effects across laboratories applies not just to the specific laboratories in the study, but to any laboratory from the broader population.\n\nModel Specification\nThe mixed-effects model for the replicated randomized block design is specified as:\n\\[\nY_{ijk} = \\mu + \\tau_i + b_j + (tb)_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ijk}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(Y_{ijk}\\): Response (wound healing) for the \\(k\\)-tjh replicate of Treatment \\(i\\) in Laboratory \\(j\\).\n\\(\\mu\\): Overall mean response\n\\(\\tau_{i}\\): Fixed effect of Treatment \\(i\\).\n\\(b_{j}\\):Random effect of Laboratory \\(j\\), assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2_{b}\\).\n\\((tb)_{ij}\\): Random interaction effect between treatment \\(i\\) and Laboratory \\(j\\), assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2_{tb}\\).\n\\(\\epsilon_{ijk}\\): Residual error term, assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\n\nModel Estimation\nSimilar as in the previous lab, we fit the mixed effects model using the lmer() function from the lmeTest package:\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Effects coding\n\nmodel_block &lt;- lmer(WoundHealing ~ Treatment + (1 | Laboratory) + \n  (1 | Treatment:Laboratory), data = data_rep_block)\nsummary(model_block)\n\nLet’s break down the model formula WoundHealing ~ Treatment + (1 | Laboratory) + (1 | Treatment:Laboratory):\n\nWoundHealing ~ Treatment: This specifies that WoundHealing is the outcome variable and that Treatment is included as a fixed effect to estimate differences between the three treatments.\n(1 | Laboratory): This specifies the random effect for laboratory, representing laboratory-specific deviations from the overall mean.\n(1 | Treatment:Laboratory): This specifies the random interaction term between Treatment and Laboratory.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the model output\nWhen we run summary(model_block), the output provides two main components: fixed effects and variance components. Together, these summarize the estimated treatment differences and the variability captured by the random effects.\n\nFixed effects\n\nThe intercept represents the overall mean wound-healing measure across all treatments and laboratories (estimated as 56.47)\n\nThe coefficients for Treatment A (-1.04) and Treatment B (+1.03) indicate how each treatment’s mean differs from the overall mean\n\nWith effects coding, the coefficients must sum to zero, so the mean for Treatment C is slightly below the overall mean (≈ -0.01)\n\nThese coefficients represent the average treatment effects across all laboratories, after adjusting for differences in baseline wound-healing levels between laboratories.\n\n\nVariance components\nThe model includes two random terms that capture distinct sources of variability:\n\nThe laboratory-level random intercept (variance = 1.446) represents systematic differences in average wound healing between laboratories\n\nThe treatment-by-laboratory interaction (variance = 0.475) captures how treatment effects vary across laboratories\n\nThe residual variance (0.909) represents unexplained variability within each treatment–laboratory combination\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the fixed effect of Wound healing treatment\nThe fixed effect of wound healing treatment can be assessed by examining the ANOVA table from the mixed-effects model. This shows whether the average wound-healing differs significantly across treatments, after accounting for variability between laboratories and treatment–laboratory interactions.\n\n# Extract the ANOVA table\nanova(model_block)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nInspect the ANOVA table and report whether the overall treatment effect is statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercise\n\n\n\nUse the emmeans package to perform pairwise comparisons between treatments and explore which pairs differ.\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the variance components\nThe variance components can be assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), which expresses how much of the total unexplained variance arises from each random effect:\n\n# Extract variance components from the fitted model and\n# square the standard deviations to obtain variances\nvc &lt;- tidy(model_block, effects = \"ran_pars\") |&gt;\n  mutate(variance = estimate^2)\nvc\n\n# Compute ICCs from the variance components\nvar_total &lt;- sum(vc$variance)\nicc_lab &lt;- vc$variance[vc$group == \"Laboratory\"] / var_total\nicc_int &lt;- vc$variance[vc$group == \"Treatment:Laboratory\"] / var_total\nicc_lab\nicc_int\n\nExplanation: The tidy() function from the broom.mixed package takes complex model output and organizes it into a standardized tidy data frame, where each row corresponds to one model parameter (e.g., fixed effect, random-effect variance, residual variance). Here, we use it to extract the random-effect variance components from the fitted model object (argument effects = \"ran_pars\")\n\nThe laboratory ICC quantifies how strongly wound-healing outcomes are correlated within the same laboratory, reflecting baseline differences between labs\nThe interaction ICC quantifies the proportion of total variability attributable to differences in treatment effects across laboratories\n\nThe larger these ICCs, the greater the divergence between a mixed-effects model and an OLS analysis that ignores the grouping structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nHow large is the ICC for the laboratory effect? What does this tell us about differences in baseline wound-healing across labs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nHow large is the ICC for the treatment-by-laboratory interaction? Does this suggest that treatment effects vary meaningfully across laboratories, or are they relatively consistent?\n\n\n\n\nModel diagnostics\nThe process of performing model diagnostics for the replicated randomized block design is the same as for the traditional randomized block design. Therefore, we refer to the previous lab for detailed instructions on assessing model assumptions and performing diagnostic checks."

What do you obverve?\n\n\n\nExplanation\n\nThe simpler model assumes identical treatment effects across laboratories\n\nAll differences between labs are captured by a single random intercept\nThis ignores any lab-to-lab variation in how the treatments perform\nAs a result, treatment effects appear more precise (smaller SEs and lower p-values)\n\nThe full model allows treatment effects to vary across laboratories via a random Treatment×Laboratory term\n\nEncodes that laboratories may show different treatment contrasts\nTreats treatment-by-lab heterogeneity as additional uncertainty about the common effect\nIncreases the SE and typically the p-value for the overall treatment effect because lab-specific deviations reduce the information for estimating a single average effect\n\n\nIn short, the main treatment effect represents the average across all laboratories. When only a few labs are available, allowing for random treatment-by-lab heterogeneity makes that average more uncertain. In this example, the difference is minor because the interaction ICC is low (0.167), meaning that little variability arises from treatment-by-lab heterogeneity. When the interaction ICC is larger, treatment effects become less certain (reflected in larger standard errors and higher p-values) because more of the total variability is due to differences in treatment performance across laboratories."

While dummy coding is widely used in multiple linear regression models, effects coding is more common in ANOVA models as it enables interpretation of group differences relative to the grand mean rather than a single reference category. This interpretative difference makes effects coding particularly useful for examining group-level effects in experimental designs.\nTo change the coding scheme globally to effects coding:\n\n# Set effects coding as the default coding scheme for unordered (nominal) factors\n# Keep the default polynomial coding for ordered (ordinal) factors\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))\n\nTo reset the coding scheme to the default dummy coding:\n\n# Reset the coding scheme for unordered factors to dummy coding\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.poly\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Estimation\nWe can fit the one-way ANOVA model using the lm() function:\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\")) # Effects coding\ncontrasts(data_oneway$Treatment) # Print contrast matrix for Treatment\n\n# Fit the one-way ANOVA model\nmodel_oneway &lt;- lm(BP_change ~ Treatment, data = data_oneway)\nsummary(model_oneway)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nHow do the estimated coefficients relate to the group means?\n\n\n\n\nANOVA Table\nTo test whether the effect of treatment is statistically significant, we use the anova() function to obtain the ANOVA table:\n\n# ANOVA table\nanova_results &lt;- anova(model_oneway)\nanova_results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat does the F-test tell us about the treatment effect?\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Marginal Means\nEstimated marginal means, also known as least-squares means, are model-based means that represent the predicted (or expected) response at each level of a factor, averaged over the levels of other variables in the model.\nIn the context of a one-way ANOVA, where there is only one factor (e.g., treatment group), the estimated marginal means are equal to the observed group means. In more complex models with multiple factors, estimated marginal means provide predicted group means that are averaged over the levels of these additional factors. For example, in a model with both treatment and age as factors, the estimated marginal means for the treatment groups show the treatment means averaged over age, illustrating what these group means are expected to be at specific values of age (or averaged over a grid of age values).\nWe can calculate the estimated marginal means using the emmeans() function from the emmeans package:\n\n# Obtain estimated marginal means\nemms &lt;- emmeans(model_oneway, ~ Treatment)\nemms  # displays EMMs with standard errors and 95% confidence intervals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nHow do the estimated marginal means compare to the observed group means calculated during the exploratory data analysis?\n\n\n\n\nPairwise comparisons\nSince we found a significant treatment effect, we will conduct pairwise comparisons of the estimated marginal means to identify which specific treatment groups differ significantly from one another. We perform these pairwise comparisons using the pairs() function from the emmeans package. To account for the increased risk of Type I error due to multiple comparisons, we apply the Bonferroni correction to adjust the p-values, ensuring that the overall significance level remains controlled.\n\n# Performing post-hoc analysis with emmeans\npairs(emms, adjust=\"Bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the pairwise comparisons, which treatment groups differ significantly?\n\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\nTo assess the adequacy of the fitted model, we create two diagnostic plots:\n\nResiduals vs Fitted Plot: Used to assess homoscedasticity (constant variance) for the errors. A random scatter of residuals around zero indicates equal variance.\nNormal Q-Q Plot: Used to assess normality of the errors. Residuals following the reference line suggest normally distributed errors.\n\n\n# Residuals vs Fitted\nplot(model_oneway, which = 1, main = \"Residuals vs Fitted\")\n\n# Normal Q-Q\nplot(model_oneway, which = 2, main = \"Normal Q-Q\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nDo the diagnostic plots suggest any violations of the model assumptions?\n\n\n\n\nReporting\nA one-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant effect of treatment on the change in systolic blood pressure, F(2, 117) = 43.86, p &lt; 0.001.

    "section": "A Mixed Effects Model for the Randomized Block Design",
    "text": "A Mixed Effects Model for the Randomized Block Design\nIn a mixed-effects model, both fixed effects and random effects are used to account for different sources of variation.\nIn the wound healing example, it is essential to account for the laboratory facility because differences between laboratories (such as variations in environmental conditions) could influence the outcome. By including laboratory as a blocking variable, we can more efficiently estimate the treatment effects by controlling for this source of variability. This can be statistically achieved by modeling laboratory as either a fixed effect or a random effect.\nWhile we could model laboratory as a fixed effect, treating it as a random effect is preferred in this case for two reasons: first, it better reflects reality, as the laboratories are considered a random sample of possible laboratory conditions; second, it reduces the number of parameters we need to estimate, making the model more parsimonious. Modeling the lab as random allows us to account for variability between laboratories without estimating a separate effect for each one, which ultimately helps to isolate the treatment effects more effectively.\nOn the other hand, treatment is modeled as a fixed effect because we are specifically interested in estimating and comparing the effectiveness of the three particular wound healing treatments (Treatment A, Treatment B, and Treatment C). These treatments are not considered random samples from a larger population of treatments; rather, they are the specific interventions under study. By modeling treatment as a fixed effect, we aim to draw conclusions about the differences between these particular treatments, and their impact on wound healing.\n\nModel Specification\nThe mixed-effects model for our randomized block design can be specified as:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + b_j + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(Y_{ij}\\): The observed wound healing response for treatment \\(i\\) in laboratory \\(j\\).\n\\(\\mu\\): The overall mean response across all treatments and laboratories.\n\\(\\tau_i\\): The fixed effect of treatment \\(i\\), representing the deviation of treatment \\(i\\) from the overall mean \\(\\mu\\).\n\\(b_j\\): The random effect of laboratory \\(j\\), assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma_b^2\\)).\n\\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\): The residual error term, assumed to be independent and normally distributed with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNotation convention\n\n\n\nIn mixed-effects models, fixed effects are typically represented by Greek letters, while random effects are represented by Roman letters. This helps differentiate between the two types of effects in model specification.\n\n\n\n\nModel Estimation\nTo fit the previously specified mixed effects model, we use the lmer() function from the lmeTest package:\n\noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))  # Effects coding\ncontrasts(data_block$Treatment) # Print contrast matrix for Treatment\n\nmodel_block &lt;- lmer(WoundHealing ~ Treatment + (1 | Laboratory), data = data_block)\nsummary(model_block)\n\n\nSyntax overview\nLet’s break down the model formula WoundHealing ~ Treatment + (1 | Laboratory)\n\nWoundHealing ~ Treatment: This specifies that WoundHealing is the outcome variable and that Treatment is included as a fixed effect to estimate differences between the three treatments. Note that the intercept is included by default in the model, so WoundHealing ~ Treatment is essentially a shortcut for WoundHealing ~ 1 + Treatment. Also remember that with effects coding, the intercept represents the overall mean across all levels of the treatment variable, and the treatment coefficients represent deviations from this mean.\n(1 | Laboratory): This specifies the random effect for Laboratory, representing laboratory-specific deviations from the overall mean.\n\n\n\nSummary overview\nWhen you run summary(model_block), the output will display:\n\nFixed Effects: Estimates of the fixed effects\n\nIntercept: The overall mean wound healing score averaged across all treatments and laboratories.\nTreatment: The differences in wound healing associated with each treatment relative to the overall mean.\n\nRandom Effects: Estimates of the variance components\n\nLaboratory - Intercept: Between-laboratory variability (\\(\\sigma^2_{b}\\)).\nResidual: Residual variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningCaution: Interpreting p-values in Mixed Effects Models\n\n\n\nWhile the lmerTest package provides p-values for fixed effects, it is important to use them with caution, primarily because methods for calculating degrees of freedom, such as Satterthwaite, are approximations that may not always be reliable, particularly in complex models fitted to imbalanced data. Hypothesis testing based on likelihood ratio tests may be preferred in those settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the fixed effects\nIn addition to providing p-values for fixed effects estimates, the lmerTest package allows us to assess the overall significance of fixed effects using the anova() function. To further explore the nature of these effects, we can obtain the estimated marginal means for the factor levels in the model. Rather than using the package’s build in ls_means() function, we will use emmeans() function from the emmeans package, which provides more options and greater flexibility.\n\n# Obtain ANOVA table for the fixed effects\nanova(model_block)\n\n\n# Compute estimated marginal means for the Treatment variable\nemms &lt;- emmeans(model_block, ~ Treatment)\nemms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat does the F-test tell us about the treatment effect?\n\n\n\nPairwise comparisons\nSince we found a significant treatment effect, we proceed with computing pairwise differences of the estimated marginal means:\n\n# Perform pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment\npairs(emms, adjust = \"bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the pairwise comparisons, which treatment groups differ significantly?\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing the variance components\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nBased on the estimated variance components from summary(model_block), calculate the intra-class correlation (ICC) and interpret its meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nConsidering these results, do you think that blocking by laboratory was necessary for this experiment?\n\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\nIn mixed-effects models, model diagnostics involve analyzing different types of residuals to evaluate how well the model fits the data and to assess whether key assumptions are satisfied.\nThe default type of residuals used in these models are the conditional residuals, which are calculated based on predicted values that incorporate both fixed effects and estimated random effects. Conditional residuals represent the deviation of the observed data from the model’s predictions, accounting for variability from both sources: fixed effects and random effects. They can be considered estimates of the errors \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\), which are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and constant variance.\nTo check these assumptions, we can generate diagnostic plots similar to those used in linear regression models:\n\nResiduals vs. Fitted Plot: This plot helps check for homoscedasticity (constant variance).\nNormal Q-Q Plot: This plot assesses whether the residuals follow a normal distribution.\n\n\n# Extract conditional residuals\nresiduals_cond &lt;- resid(model_block)\n\n# Residuals vs Fitted\nplot(fitted(model_block), residuals_cond,\n     main = \"Residuals vs Fitted\",\n     xlab = \"Fitted values\",\n     ylab = \"Residuals\")\nabline(h = 0, col = \"red\")\n\n# Normal Q-Q Plot\nqqnorm(residuals_cond)\nqqline(residuals_cond, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion\n\n\n\nDo the diagnostic plots suggest any violations of the model assumptions regarding the error term?"

When analyzing an interaction, we have a choice in how to decompose it. We could examine either the effect of therapy type (Standard vs Enhanced vs Control) separately for each disease severity level, or alternatively, we could examine the effect of disease severity (Mild vs Severe) separately for each therapy type.\nIn this clinical context, we choose to examine the effect of therapy type conditional on disease severity level. This choice is clinically motivated: from a treatment planning perspective, clinicians need to know which therapies work best for patients presenting with different disease severity levels. Understanding how therapy effectiveness varies across severity groups directly informs treatment decisions and allows for severity-stratified recommendations.

    "text": "Steps to Complete the Analysis\n\n1. Load the dataset\nWhen loading the dataset in R, ensure that the ExerciseRoutine variable is treated as a factor. One way to achieve this is by specifying the column type explicitly using the colClasses argument in the read.csv() function. For example:\n\n# Load the dataset and specify ExerciseRoutine as a factor\ndataset &lt;- read.csv(\"functional_mobility.csv\", colClasses = c(\"ExerciseRoutine\" = \"factor\"))\n\n\n\n2. Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nVisualize the data using an interaction plot.\nCalculate descriptive statistics for each exercise routine and patient.\n\n\n\n3. Fit a Mixed-Effects Model\n\nFit a mixed-effects model with:\n\nFixed Effects: ExerciseRoutine (to estimate differences between exercise routines).\nRandom Effects:\n\nPatient (to account for variability between individuals).\nPatient × ExerciseRoutine (to account for potential variability in how patients respond to different routines).\n\n\nSummarize the model:\n\nReport the fixed effects and variance components.\n\n\n\n\n4. Test for Overall Differences\n\nUse the selected model to test for overall differences in functional mobility scores across exercise routines.\nIf significant overall differences are found, perform pairwise comparisons to identify which routines differ.\n\n\n\n5. Assess variance components\n\nCalculate ICCs to evaluate the variance components\n\n\n\n6. Evaluate Model Assumptions\n\nAssess the model’s assumptions (e.g., normality of residuals, homoscedasticity) using diagnostic plots."
