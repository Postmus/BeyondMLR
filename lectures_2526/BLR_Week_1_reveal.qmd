## Introduction

- Multiple linear regression models are widely used to study how a numerical outcome changes with one or more explanatory variables
- However, in many medical applications, the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors underlying linear regression is violated
- This occurs when observations are grouped, but the grouping structure is ignored in the analysis
  - For example: patients treated in the same hospital, teeth from the same patient, or pupils within the same school
- In such cases, linear mixed-effects models can be used to estimate overall effects across all groups (fixed effects) while accounting for group-specific variation (random effects)
- This course focuses on the application of linear mixed-effects models in a variety of settings, including blocked, hierarchical, and longitudinal data

## Course organization 

- Before class: preparatory reading of selected book chapters  
- During class: build understanding through introductory lectures and develop data analysis skills through guided application exercises in the R labs
- After class: assignment to apply what you have learned from the readings and in-class activities to a new dataset

## Quarto (assignments)

- Quarto is an open-source publishing system that allows you to create dynamic, high-quality reports from a single source file containing both text and R code
  - As such, it enables reproducible research by integrating code and text, ensuring that reports and analyses are always up-to-date
- Quarto uses Markdown for formatting of headings, text, and tables and supports LaTeX for typesetting mathematical equations and handling references and citations
- It can be used to create a variety of outputs, including HTML, PDF, Word documents, slides, and even websites and blogs

## Requirements to earn course certificate

- To earn the course certificate, you must participate in at least 80% of the in-class meetings, and submit the weekly data analysis assignments
- For students requiring a grade, such as research master students or PhD students seeking Epidemiologist B registration, grading will be based on the final data analysis assignment

# Part 1: Experiments with a single experimental factor

## Case study — weight loss interventions

- Design: 120 adults with obesity are randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups (n = 40 each): control (no treatment), lifestyle modification, or pharmacological treatment
- Response (outcome): change in body weight (kg) from baseline to week 12 (negative values indicate weight loss)

```{r}
#| echo: false
set.seed(123)
control  <- rnorm(40, mean = -0.5, sd = 3)
lifestyle<- rnorm(40, mean = -2.5, sd = 3)
drug     <- rnorm(40, mean = -4.0, sd = 3)

df_weight <- data.frame(
  Treatment = factor(rep(c("Control","Lifestyle","Pharmacological"), each = 40),
                     levels = c("Control","Lifestyle","Pharmacological")),
  Weight_change = c(control, lifestyle, drug)
)

# Apply effects coding
contrasts(df_weight$Treatment) <- contr.sum(3)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
boxplot(Weight_change ~ Treatment, data = df_weight,
        col = c("gray85","skyblue","lightgreen"),
        ylab = "Change in body weight (kg)",
        main = NULL)
abline(h = 0, lty = 2, col = "darkgray")
```


## Statistical model specification

To compare the mean change in body weight across the three treatment groups, we use the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model:

$$
Y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \varepsilon_{ij}
$$

- Model components:
  - $Y_{ij}$: change in body weight for the $j$-th subject in the $i$-th treatment group
  - $\mu$ (grand mean): the overall mean across groups (the average of the group means)
  - $\tau_i$ (treatment deviations): the deviation of the mean of group $i$ from the grand mean; constrained so $\sum_i \tau_i = 0$
  - $\varepsilon_{ij}$ (residual error): the deviation for subject $j$ from the mean of group $i$
- Statistical assumptions:
  - $\varepsilon_{ij}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$: errors are independent and identically normally distributed with mean zero and common variance $\sigma^2$ (homoscedasticity)

## Estimation using linear regression

- A one-way ANOVA can be performed using the linear regression framework  
- To reproduce the ANOVA model specification, **effects coding** (sum-to-zero contrasts) is used, with *Pharmacological* as the implied category  
- The table below shows how treatment levels are coded and the corresponding estimated regression coefficients

:::: {.columns style="font-size:70%"}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Variable coding (effects coding)**

| Treatment         | Intercept | Treatment1 | Treatment2 |
|-------------------|:----------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| Control           | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Lifestyle         | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Pharmacological   | 1 | −1 | −1 |

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Estimated coefficients**

```{r}
#| echo: false
fit <- lm(Weight_change ~ Treatment, data = df_weight)
kable(
  tidy(fit)[, c("term","estimate","std.error","p.value")],
  digits = 3,
  format = "html",
  table.attr = 'style="font-size: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: auto"'
)
```

:::

::::

```{=html}
<div style="margin-top:1em;"></div>
```

- With effects coding, the intercept corresponds to the **grand mean**, and the treatment coefficients represent **group deviations** from that mean
- This differs from dummy coding, where the intercept equals the mean of the reference group, and each coefficient represents the difference between that group and the reference

## Estimated marginal means (EMMs)

- ANOVA parameters describe how each group mean deviates from the overall (grand) mean
- Estimated marginal means (EMMs) re-express the same model in terms of the expected mean outcome for each group
- In a one-way ANOVA, the EMMs are identical to the observed group means
- In models with multiple factors, EMMs represent predicted group means that are averaged over the levels of the other factors in the model

```{=html}
<div style="margin-top:1.0em;"></div>
```

```{r}
kable(
  tidy(emmeans(fit, ~ Treatment)),
  digits = 3,
  format = "html",
  table.attr = 'style="font-size: 80%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: auto"'
)
```

## ANOVA table and global hypothesis test

- The total variation in the outcome ($SS_{Total}$) can be split into two parts:
  - **Between-group variation** ($SS_{Treatment}$): how much group means differ from the overall mean  
  - **Within-group variation** ($SS_{Residual}$): how much individual outcomes vary around their group mean  

- **Hypotheses**
  - $H_0$: all group means are equal ($\tau_{Control} = \tau_{Lifestyle} = \tau_{Pharmacological} = 0$) 
  - $H_1$: at least one group mean differs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Test statistic**
  $$
  F = \frac{MS_{Treatment}}{MS_{Residual}}
    = \frac{SS_{Treatment} / (g - 1)}{SS_{Residual} / (N - g)}
  $$

```

::::

- Under $H_0$, this follows an $F_{g-1,\,N-g}$ distribution  
- A large $F$ (>>1) means that treatment explains more variation between groups than expected by chance

## Post-hoc comparisons

- When the overall treatment effect is significant, pairwise comparisons of the estimated marginal means can be performed to determine which specific treatment groups differ significantly from one another
- To account for the increased risk of Type I error from multiple testing, the resulting p-values should be adjusted using an appropriate multiplicity correction (for example, the Bonferroni method) to keep the overall significance level controlled

kable(
  tidy(emmeans(fit, ~ Treatment)),

  digits = 3,
  format = "html",
  table.attr = 'style="font-size: 80%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: auto"'
)
```

## Model diagnostics

- To assess the adequacy of the fitted model, different diagnostic plots can be created:
  - **Normal Q-Q Plot**: Used to assess normality of the errors
  - **Residuals vs Fitted Plot**: Used to assess homoscedasticity (constant variance) for the errors

# Part 2: Experiments with an experimental and a blocking factor

## Context variables

- Context variables are factors that define shared conditions under which observations are made but are not of primary interest
  - Examples: study center, laboratory batch, or litter
- If ignored, such factors can:
  - Reduce power to detect the treatment effect of interest
  - Obscure or bias treatment comparisons if unevenly distributed across groups

## Randomized block designs

- Design stage
  - Experimental units are grouped into blocks defined by levels of a context variable
  - Treatments are randomized within each block, ensuring that comparisons are made under similar conditions and bias is avoided
- Analysis stage
  - The context variable is included as second factor in the model:  
  
  $$Y_{ijk} = \mu + \tau_i + \beta_j + \varepsilon_{ijk}$$

  - This additive model separates block effects ($\beta_j$) from residual error ($\varepsilon_{ijk}$), reducing unexplained variability and increasing the precision of treatment estimates
  - The resulting statistical model is known as a **two-way additive ANOVA**
 
## Example: lab animal experiment

```{r}
set.seed(329)  # For reproducibility

# Increase between-cage variability
between_cage_sd <- 2  # Standard deviation for the cage effect

# Cage effect (one random effect per cage)
cage_effect <- rnorm(8, mean = 0, sd = between_cage_sd)

# Simulate data with larger cage effect
data <- data.frame(
  Cage = rep(1:8, times = 3),
  Treatment = rep(c("Placebo", "20 mg", "50 mg"), each = 8),
  Weight_Change = c(rnorm(8, mean = 14 + cage_effect, sd = 2),
                    rnorm(8, mean = 13 + cage_effect, sd = 2),
                    rnorm(8, mean = 11 + cage_effect, sd = 2))
)

data$Treatment <- factor(data$Treatment, levels=c("Placebo", "20 mg", "50 mg"))
data$Cage <- as.factor(data$Cage)
contrasts(data$Treatment) <- contr.sum(3)
contrasts(data$Cage) <- contr.sum(8)
```

- Objective: test the potential toxic effects of an experimental drug X by assessing changes in body weight in rats
- Study design:
  - Animals: 24 Sprague-Dawley rats
  - Groups:
    - Control Group: 8 rats receive a placebo
    - Drug X Group 1: 8 rats receive Drug X at 20 mg/kg/day
    - Drug X Group 2: 8 rats receive Drug X at 50 mg/kg/day
- Blocking by cage placement: randomization of treatments within each cage to control for variability due to environmental factors (e.g., light, temperature)

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
# Create the scatter plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Weight_Change, y = factor(Cage), color = Treatment)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  labs(title = NULL,
       x = "Weight Change (grams)",
       y = "Cage",
       color = "Treatment") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

- Ignoring cage differences pushes cage-to-cage variability into the residual error term
- This reduces power compared with models that account for the cage effect

## Incorporating the effect of cage

- Two options to include cage in the model
  - Treat cage as a fixed effect: adjust for these eight cages
    - Each level gets its own estimate
    - Inference applies only to these specific levels
    - Example: “How do rats in cage 1 compare to those in cage 2?”
  - Treat cage as a random effect: account for cage to cage variability
    - We are not interested in individual cages, but in their variability
    - Inference generalizes to the population of possible cages
    - Example: “How much do rat weights differ between cages on average?”

- Treats cage as a random effect sampled from a population of possible cages
- Estimates treatment effects and between cage variance and generalizes beyond these cages

## Understanding variance components

- In the one-way ANOVA that ignored cage, all unexplained variation was captured by a single residual error term → this error combined both *between-cage* and *within-cage* differences

- In the two-way ANOVA with cage as a random effect, that residual variability is *partitioned* into two parts:
  1. Between-cage variance: how much average weight change differs between cages
  2. Within-cage (residual) variance: how much rats differ within the same cage after accounting for both treatment and cage effects

| component | variance | sd |
|------------|-----------|----|
| Cage | 3.507 | 1.873 |
| Residual | 3.124 | 1.768 |

- Together, these are the **variance components**: they describe how the total unexplained variability from the simpler model is partitioned into variation **between** and **within** cage

## Intra-class correlation (ICC)

- The intra-class correlation (ICC) quantifies the proportion of the total unexplained variability that is due to between-cage differences:

$$
ICC = \frac{\sigma^2_{\text{cage}}}{\sigma^2_{\text{cage}} + \sigma^2_{\text{residual}}}
     = \frac{3.507}{3.507 + 3.124} = 0.529
$$

- Here, ICC ≈ 0.53, meaning that about 53% of the remaining variation (after accounting for treatment) arises from differences between cages
- Interpretation:
  - High ICC: rats in the same cage tend to have more similar outcomes
  - Low ICC: cage membership adds little information beyond treatment
