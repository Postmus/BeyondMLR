## Introduction

- Welcome slide (to be completed later)

## Case study — antihypertensive treatments

- Design: 120 patients with hypertension are randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 40 each): Control, Drug A, or Drug B
- Response (outcome): change in SBP (mmHg) from baseline to week 52

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Prepare example data once for subsequent slides (hidden)
set.seed(123)
control <- rnorm(40, mean = -3,  sd = 15)
drugA   <- rnorm(40, mean = -10, sd = 15)
drugB   <- rnorm(40, mean = -5,  sd = 15)
df_bp <- data.frame(
  Treatment = factor(rep(c("Control","DrugA","DrugB"), each = 40),
                     levels = c("Control","DrugA","DrugB")),
  SBP_change = c(control, drugA, drugB)
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
boxplot(SBP_change ~ Treatment, data = df_bp,
        col = c("gray85","skyblue","lightgreen"),
        ylab = "Change in SBP (mmHg)", main = NULL)
```

## Statistical model specification

To compare the mean change in SBP across the three treatment groups, we use the one-way ANOVA model:

$$
Y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \varepsilon_{ij}
$$

- Model components:
  - $Y_{ij}$: change in SBP observed for the $j$-th subject in the $i$-th treatment group
  - $\mu$ (grand mean): the overall mean across groups (the average of the group means)
  - $\tau_i$ (treatment deviations): the deviation of the mean of group $i$ from the grand mean; constrained so $\sum_i \tau_i = 0$
  - $\varepsilon_{ij}$ (residual error): the deviation for subject $j$ from the mean of group $i$
- Statistical assumptions:
  - $\varepsilon_{ij}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$: errors are independent and identically normally distributed with mean zero and common variance $\sigma^2$ (homoscedasticity)

## Estimation using linear regression

- A one-way ANOVA model can be expressed as a linear regression with a categorical predictor, allowing us to use the regression framework for estimation and hypothesis testing
- Using dummy coding with the control group as reference, the statistically equivalent regression model is:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Mapping to the ANOVA model parameters

- Intercept and betas → group means:
  - mean(Control) = $\beta_0$
  - mean(DrugA)   = $\beta_0 + \beta_1$
  - mean(DrugB)   = $\beta_0 + \beta_2$

- Grand mean (ANOVA intercept):
  $\mu = \frac{\text{mean(Control)} + \text{mean(DrugA)} + \text{mean(DrugB)}}{3} = \beta_0 + \frac{\beta_1 + \beta_2}{3}$

- Treatment deviations (ANOVA $\tau_i$) written in terms of the regression coefficients:
  - $\tau_{\text{Control}} = \text{mean(Control)} - \mu = -\frac{\beta_1 + \beta_2}{3}$
  - $\tau_{\text{DrugA}}   = \text{mean(DrugA)} - \mu = \beta_1 - \frac{\beta_1 + \beta_2}{3}$
  - $\tau_{\text{DrugB}}   = \text{mean(DrugB)} - \mu = \beta_2 - \frac{\beta_1 + \beta_2}{3}$

## ANOVA table

  tidy(anova(fit)),

)
```

```{=html}
<div style="margin-top:1.5em;"></div>
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Sum of squares decomposition**

- Total variability splits into $SS_{Total} = SS_{Treatment} + SS_{Residual}$  
  - $SS_{Treatment}$: variation explained by treatment  
  - $SS_{Residual}$: unexplained (within-group) variation  
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Global hypothesis test (F-test)**

- Global test of equal means  
  - $H_0: \tau_{Control} = \tau_{DrugA} = \tau_{DrugB} = 0$  
  - $F = \frac{MS_{Treatment}}{MS_{Residual}}$  
- Here, the p-value is $\leq 0.05$, so we reject $H_0$ and conclude that the treatment has a significant effect on the change in SBP

:::

::::

## Post-hoc comparisons

- Since we found a significant effect of treatment, we will conduct pairwise comparisons of the estimated group means to identify which specific treatment groups differ significantly from one another
- To account for the increased Type I error risk due to multiple comparisons, we apply the Bonferroni correction to adjust the p-values, ensuring that the overall significance level remains controlled

```{r}
# Performing post-hoc analysis with emmeans
emms <- emmeans(fit, ~ Treatment)
contrast(emms, method="pairwise", adjust="Bonferroni")
```

## Model diagnostics

- To assess the adequacy of the fitted model, we create two diagnostic plots:
  - **Normal Q-Q Plot**: Used to assess normality of the errors
  - **Residuals vs Fitted Plot**: Used to assess homoscedasticity (constant variance) for the errors

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
# Normal Q-Q
plot(fit, which = 2, main = "Normal Q-Q")

# Part II

## Nuisance variables

- Nuisance variables are variables that influence the response but are not of primary interest
- Examples include age, baseline blood pressure, comorbidity, or study center
- If not controlled, they can
  - increase random variation → more noise, less precision
  - introduce systematic differences between treatment groups → biased estimates of treatment effects
- Randomization helps balance nuisance variables across treatments on average
- Additional control can be achieved through blocking or covariate adjustment to separate their influence from the treatment effect

## Reducing residual variation: blocking

- Design stage
  - Group experimental units that are similar on a known nuisance variable (e.g., study center, sex, baseline severity)
  - Randomize treatments within each block to ensure balance across levels of the nuisance variable  (this is known as an orthogonal design)

- Analysis stage
  - Include the block term in the statistical model (two-way ANOVA)

  $$Y_{ijk} = \mu + \tau_i + \beta_j + \varepsilon_{ijk}$$

  - This analysis separates block effects from the residual error and therefore allows treatment effects to be estimated with increased precision

## First example: stratified randomization

- Study population: 135 patients with baseline SBP ≥140 mmHg, classified into three hypertension grades
  - Grade 1: 140–159 mmHg
  - Grade 2: 160–179 mmHg
  - Grade 3: ≥180 mmHg
- Randomization: performed separately within each grade to ensure that all treatments are represented equally across hypertension categories (stratified randomization)
- Treatments: Control, Drug A, Drug B (n = 45 per group; 15 per grade)
- Outcome: change in SBP (mmHg) from baseline to week 52

- Effect of blocking / stratification:
  - When a nuisance factor (here: hypertension grade) is ignored, its between-group variation is absorbed into $MS_{Residual}$, increasing the denominator of the F ratio
  - Including the grade as an additional factor (two-way ANOVA) partitions out that systematic variation into a separate term
  - This typically reduces $MS_{Residual}$ while leaving $MS_{Treatment}$ approximately the same in balanced/orthogonal designs
  - Because the denominator is reduced, the F statistic for treatment tends to increase and the test gains power to detect treatment differences

## Second example: randomized block design

```{r}
set.seed(329)  # For reproducibility

# Increase between-cage variability
between_cage_sd <- 2  # Standard deviation for the cage effect

# Cage effect (one random effect per cage)
cage_effect <- rnorm(8, mean = 0, sd = between_cage_sd)

# Simulate data with larger cage effect
data <- data.frame(
  Cage = rep(1:8, times = 3),
  Treatment = rep(c("Placebo", "20 mg", "50 mg"), each = 8),
  Weight_Change = c(rnorm(8, mean = 14 + cage_effect, sd = 2),
                    rnorm(8, mean = 13 + cage_effect, sd = 2),
                    rnorm(8, mean = 11 + cage_effect, sd = 2))
)

data$Treatment <- factor(data$Treatment, levels=c("Placebo", "20 mg", "50 mg"))
```

- Objective: test the potential toxic effects of an experimental drug X by assessing changes in body weight in rats
- Study design:
  - Animals: 24 Sprague-Dawley rats
  - Groups:
    - Control Group: 8 rats receive a placebo
    - Drug X Group 1: 8 rats receive Drug X at 20 mg/kg/day
    - Drug X Group 2: 8 rats receive Drug X at 50 mg/kg/day
- Blocking by cage placement: randomization of treatments within each cage to control for variability due to environmental factors (e.g., light, temperature)

- Ignoring cage differences pushes cage-to-cage variability into the residual
- This inflates standard errors and reduces power compared with models that adjust for cages

## Incorporating the effect of cage

- Some cages show consistently higher or lower weights, suggesting an extra source of variation due to the cage environment
- Two options to include cage in the model
  - Treat cage as a fixed effect: adjust for these eight cages
    - Each level gets its own estimate  
    - Inference applies only to these specific levels  
    - Example: “How do rats in cage 1 compare to those in cage 2?”
  - Treat cage as a random effect: account for cage to cage variability
    - We are not interested in individual cages, but in their variability  
    - Inference generalizes to the population of possible cages  
    - Example: “How much do rat weights differ between cages on average?”

$$

- Adds one separate parameter for each cage  
- The model becomes more complex as more cages are added 
- No estimate of how much cages differ on average

**Random-effects specification**

$$
Y_{ijk} = \mu + \tau_i + b_j + \varepsilon_{ijk}, \quad b_j \sim N(0, \sigma_b^2)

- $b_j$: random intercept describing how cage $j$ differs from the overall mean  
- Estimates the average variability between cages ($\sigma_b^2$)

- Treats cage as a random effect sampled from a population of possible cages
- Estimates treatment effects and between cage variance and generalizes beyond these cages

## Understanding variance components

- In the one-way ANOVA that ignored cage, all unexplained variation was captured by a single residual error term → this error combined both *between-cage* and *within-cage* differences

- In the two-way ANOVA with cage as a random effect, that residual variability is *partitioned* into two parts:
  1. Between-cage variance: how much average weight change differs between cages  
  2. Within-cage (residual) variance: how much rats differ within the same cage after accounting for both treatment and cage effects

| component | variance | sd |
|------------|-----------|----|
| Cage | 3.507 | 1.873 |
| Residual | 3.124 | 1.768 |

- Together, these are the **variance components**: they describe how the total unexplained variability from the simpler model is partitioned into variation **between** and **within** cage

## Intra-class correlation (ICC)

- The intra-class correlation (ICC) quantifies the proportion of the total unexplained variability that is due to between-cage differences:

$$
ICC = \frac{\sigma^2_{\text{cage}}}{\sigma^2_{\text{cage}} + \sigma^2_{\text{residual}}}
     = \frac{3.507}{3.507 + 3.124} = 0.529
$$

- Here, ICC ≈ 0.53, meaning that about 53% of the remaining variation (after accounting for treatment) arises from differences between cages
- Interpretation:
  - High ICC: rats in the same cage tend to have more similar outcomes  
  - Low ICC: cage membership adds little information beyond treatment

## Fixed or random effects for nuisance variables

- **Stratified randomization example:**  
  - The stratification factor (hypertension grade) divides subjects into predefined categories used consistently across studies  
  - The specific levels (grade 1, grade 2, grade 3) are fixed and always the same 
  - The factor is modeled as a **fixed effect**, adjusting for systematic differences between these known categories

- **Randomized block design example:**  
  - The blocking factor (cage) represents a random source of environmental variation  
  - The cages themselves are not of intrinsic interest and could have been any comparable set   
  - Modeling cage as a **random effect** captures this variability naturally and allows generalization beyond the observed cages

## Linear regression with effects coding

- Another common choice is effects (sum-to-zero) coding
- With this coding the regression coefficients map directly to the ANOVA parameters:

$$
Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 E_{1,ij} + \beta_2 E_{2,ij} + \varepsilon_{ij}
$$

where $E_1, E_2$ are the effect indicators for Control and DrugA (see table below).

| Treatment | Intercept | E1 | E2 |
|---|---:|:---:|:---:|
| Control | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| DrugA   | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| DrugB   | 1 | -1 | -1 |

- Interpretation:
  - Intercept ($\beta_0$): grand mean ($\mu$)
  - $\beta_1$ = $\tau_{\text{Control}}$ (deviation of Control from grand mean)
  - $\beta_2$ = $\tau_{\text{DrugA}}$ (deviation of DrugA from grand mean)
  - The remaining group's deviation follows from the sum-to-zero constraint: $\tau_{\text{DrugB}} = -\beta_1 - \beta_2$

## Estimated regression coefficients (effects coded model)

```{r}
#| echo: false
## R: effects (sum-to-zero) coding
contrasts(df_bp$Treatment) <- contr.sum(levels(df_bp$Treatment))
fit2 <- lm(SBP_change ~ Treatment, data = df_bp)
summary(fit2)
```

## Estimated marginal means (EMMs)

- Regression coefficients describe differences relative to a reference group
- Estimated marginal means (EMMs) express the same model in terms of predicted group means
- In a one-way ANOVA model, the EMMs equal the observed group means
- In more complex models, EMMs give adjusted or conditional means that make comparisons fairer
  - With covariates (ANCOVA): EMMs adjust group means to a common covariate value, such as the overall mean
  - With interactions: EMMs provide conditional means for specific combinations of factors, allowing group comparisons at chosen settings

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Compute and display estimated marginal means
emms <- emmeans(fit, ~ Treatment)
summary(emms)
```
